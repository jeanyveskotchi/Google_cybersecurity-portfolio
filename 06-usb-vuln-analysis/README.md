# Removable Media (USB) Risk Analysis

**Scenario:** Unknown USB found in hospital parking lot; inspected in **isolated VM sandbox**.

## Risks
- Mixed personal and work data → privacy & compliance exposure.
- Files with PII (e.g., new hire letters, budget trackers) → target for **phishing/impersonation**.
- Photos and docs aid **social engineering**.

## Controls
- **Technical:** USB restrictions, device control, encryption at rest, endpoint malware scanning.
- **Operational:** Training on removable media, data classification/handling policies.
- **Process:** Incident intake & chain of custody; sandbox triage SOP.
