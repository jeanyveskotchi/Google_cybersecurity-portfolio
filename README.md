# Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate Portfolio

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio — a curated collection of projects and case studies completed throughout the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate**.  
This repository showcases how I applied core cybersecurity concepts to real-world scenarios including auditing, threat detection, incident response, and automation.

---

## Objective

This portfolio demonstrates my ability to **think like a defender**, analyze risks, secure networks, respond to incidents, and automate routine security operations.  
It represents my foundation as a future **Security Analyst / SOC Analyst / Cybersecurity Engineer**.

## What I Learned

Throughout this program, I built a hands-on understanding of the **core domains of cybersecurity**:

| Domain | Key Learning |
|--------|---------------|
| **Security Foundations** | Principles of confidentiality, integrity, availability (CIA triad), defense in depth, zero trust, least privilege |
| **Risk Management** | Asset classification, threat modeling, vulnerability assessment, and control prioritization |
| **Network Security** | TCP/IP layers, DNS, ICMP, ports & protocols, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems |
| **Incident Response** | Phases of IR (Preparation → Identification → Containment → Eradication → Recovery → Lessons Learned) |
| **System Hardening** | Password policies, encryption, OS & application patching, secure configuration, and access control |
| **Security Frameworks** | NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), ISO 27001, PCI DSS, GDPR, and SOC 2 |
| **Digital Forensics** | Collecting indicators of compromise (IOCs), log analysis, chain of custody, and evidence integrity |
| **Automation & Scripting** | Writing Python scripts for allow/deny list updates, file parsing, and threat data filtering |
| **Governance & Compliance** | Building audit reports, assessing policies, and recommending control improvements |

## Sample Project Highlights

### **Internal Audit — Botium Toys**
Assessed organizational compliance with PCI DSS, GDPR, and SOC frameworks.  
Recommended RBAC, encryption of cardholder data, and data classification.

### **Network Layer Analysis**
Diagnosed DNS misconfiguration using ICMP "Destination Unreachable" messages and resolved root cause through firewall inspection.

### **SYN Flood Investigation**
Analyzed packet captures showing SYN floods; implemented SYN cookies and rate limiting for mitigation.

### **OS Hardening**
Mitigated a web malware infection caused by weak credentials and missing HTTPS enforcement.

### ⚙️ **Incident Response Plan (NIST CSF)**
Structured an ICMP flood response using NIST CSF functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.

### **Removable Media Vulnerability**
Assessed the risks of inserting unknown USB drives; documented chain-of-custody procedures.

### **Python Automation**
Developed a script that safely removes blacklisted IPs from allow-lists using file I/O and clean error handling.

## Career Readiness

By completing this program, I developed practical cybersecurity skills aligned with entry-level roles such as:

- **Security Analyst / SOC Analyst**  
- **Incident Response Technician**  
- **Cyber Threat Researcher**  
- **IT Security Specialist**

I can now confidently:
- Analyze packet captures and log data to identify malicious activity  
- Apply risk assessment and mitigation techniques  
- Use frameworks (NIST CSF, MITRE ATT&CK) to structure security operations  
- Automate repetitive security tasks with Python

## Reflection

> “Cybersecurity isn’t just about stopping attacks — it’s about understanding how systems fail, why users make mistakes, and how to build trust back into technology.”

This certification taught me **how to think like an attacker, but act like a defender**.  
I now approach problems with curiosity, discipline, and analytical precision — core qualities for a cybersecurity professional.
